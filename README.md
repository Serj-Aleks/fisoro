FiSoro is a free and open source Java script library which internally uses AngularJS 1.
FiSoro allows a browser-side search of business data practically without load on the server.
FiSoro does it with the help of prepared JSON files. The site operator must regenerate these files with a regular time interval or after each relevant change of data.
In reality the most backend systems provide one or more options to do that. For example, the content management system (CMS) often have no own database but have embedded scripting languages for generating the help files.

How FiSoro works, you can see by my special number shop at www.sirotin.eu/FiSoro/NumberShop/NumberShop.html  or http://bit.ly/2c5MCt1
